### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

well I used JavaScript for the first time!
```html
 <div class="circle empty"></div> <!-- I learnt that I can use two classes in the same element-->
```
```css
.balance .balanceRight .circle{
    width: 30px;
    height: 30px;
    border-radius: 50%;
}  /*I learnt how to create circles with only html and css*/
```
```js
friday.onmouseover=function(){
    document.getElementById('n5').style.display='block';
}
friday.onmouseout=function(){
    document.getElementById('n5').style.display='none';
} /* I learnt to hide and show elements in html with JS*/ 
```

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) - This helped me for using javascript reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ANP3LTStZg) - This is an amazing video which helped me finally understand how to create graph. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
